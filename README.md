# pyqt5-spotipy-wrapper
Small client wrapping most functions of the Spotify API with a UI made in PyQt5.

Requirements: Python (3+?), Spotipy (2.19?), PyQt5, a Spotify Developer account.

Create a Spotify Developer account here: https://developer.spotify.com/ 

Once you get the API credentials, edit the spotify_credentials.txt file as it instructs in the file.

Make sure to start playing a song from Spotify before launching the app, it can't start without some sort of playback going on.

Launch by running the qt5oop.py file, make sure you're running from the pyqt5-spotify-wrapper folder because the icons are specified by relative path.
